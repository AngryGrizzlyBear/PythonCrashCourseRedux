# the class will work; just pick the one you like better. Add an attribute called
# flavors that stores a list of ice cream flavors. Write a method that displays
# these flavors. Create an instance of IceCreamStand, and call this method.

# 9-7. Admin: An administrator is a special kind of user. Write a class called
# Admin that inherits from the User class you wrote in Exercise 9-3 (page 166)
# or Exercise 9-5 (page 171). Add an attribute, privileges, that stores a list
# of strings like "can add post", "can delete post", "can ban user", and so on.
# Write a method called show_privileges() that lists the administrator’s set of
# privileges. Create an instance of Admin, and call your method.

# 9-8. Privileges: Write a separate Privileges class. The class should have one
# attribute, privileges, that stores a list of strings as described in Exercise 9-7.
# Move the show_privileges() method to this class. Make a Privileges instance
# as an attribute in the Admin class. Create a new instance of Admin and use your
# method to show its privileges.

# 9-9. Battery Upgrade: Use the final version of electric_car.py from this section.
# Add a method to the Battery class called upgrade_battery(). This method
# should check the battery size and set the capacity to 85 if it isn’t already.
# Make an electric car with a default battery size, call get_range() once, and
# then call get_range() a second time after upgrading the battery. You should
# see an increase in the car’s range.
