# 8-3. T-Shirt: Write a function called make_shirt() that accepts a size and the
# text of a message that should be printed on the shirt. The function should print
# a sentence summarizing the size of the shirt and the message printed on it.
# Call the function once using positional arguments to make a shirt. Call the
# function a second time using keyword arguments.
def make_shirt(shirt_size = 'Large', shirt_message = 'I love Python!'):
    print(shirt_size + " is the shirt size.")
    print(shirt_message + " is the shirt message.")

make_shirt()
make_shirt(shirt_size = 'medium')
make_shirt('small', 'Programmers are loopy.')
# 8-4. Large Shirts: Modify the make_shirt() function so that shirts are large
# by default with a message that reads I love Python. Make a large shirt and a
# medium shirt with the default message, and a shirt of any size with a different
# message.


# 8-5. Cities: Write a function called describe_city() that accepts the name of
# a city and its country. The function should print a simple sentence, such as
# Reykjavik is in Iceland. Give the parameter for the country a default value.
# Call your function for three different cities, at least one of which is not in the
# default country
def describe_city(city, country ='chile'):
    msg = city.title() + " is in " + country.title() + "."
    print(msg)

describe_city('santiago')
describe_city('reykjavik', 'iceland')
