# 8-6. City Names: Write a function called city_country() that takes in the name
# of a city and its country. The function should return a string formatted like this:
# "Santiago, Chile"
# Call your function with at least three city-country pairs, and print the value
# that’s returned.

def city_country(city, country):
    """Return a string like 'Santiago, Chilie'."""
    return(city.title() + ", " + country.title())

city = city_country(' santiago', 'chile')
print(city)
city = city_country(' ushuaia', 'argentina')
print(city)
city = city_country(' longyearbeyen', 'svalbard')
print(city)

# 8-7. Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a dictionary
# describing a music album. The function should take in an artist name and an
# album title, and it should return a dictionary containing these two pieces of
# information. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different
# albums. Print each return value to show that the dictionaries are storing the
# album information correctly.
# Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the
# number of tracks on an album. If the calling line includes a value for the number
# of tracks, add that value to the album’s dictionary. Make at least one new
# function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.
def make_album(artist, title, tracks=0):
    """Build a dictionary containing information about an album."""
    album_dict = {
        'artist': artist.title(),
        'title': title.title(),
    }
    if tracks:
        album_dict['tracks'] = tracks
    return album_dict

album = make_album('metallica', 'ride the lightning')

print(album)

album = make_album('willie nelson', 'red-headed stranger')
print(album)

album = make_album('iron maiden', 'piece of mind', tracks=8)
print(album)

# 8-8. User Albums: Start with your program from Exercise 8-7. Write a while
# loop that allows users to enter an album’s artist and title. Once you have that
# information, call make_album() with the user’s input and print the dictionary
# that’s created. Be sure to include a quit value in the while loop
